We also are working in a chat bot to handle any immediate inquiries. This chat isn\'t for regular B2C communications its actually an internal program for trainees to talk to agents that can answer questions within their Vtiger CRM system.

Ophion was a solo passion project I created back in 2016 as a response to my mangers (at the time when I worked at Dick\'s Sporting Goods) complaining about their employee management software that they use and the complication of using it. This is really when I started learning to code and focus on intuitive design and user experience. The project stalled out as I started working in the field but still remains as a humble aspiration I had to make revolutionary software for multiple businesses. I was hoping to make this modular enough that multiple different companies would be able to sign up their stores and utilize the software as a service to better managing their employees and their needs. There is also a portal for employees to log in to manage their time slots, availability, request vacations and communicate with other employees directly in the web app. I designed this with an emphasis on dark mode first and company branding.', //short desc
