Identify User Needs, Create Intuitive Experiences, Develop Functional Prototypes 
I'm a pre-med student turned tech-ethusiast. 

In my professional time I've slowly focused in on the parts of the web development field that bring me the most enjoyment. I've gained a lot of experience doing things like project managing, desgining graphics for apps in the app store,

Because I love disverity in my creations, I tend to like working for a company that deals with multiple clients in different categories i.e.: Finance, Logistics, Entertainment, Food Industry, Content Sharing, CRM, Warehouse Management and more.

In my spare time, I have my home office set up as a recording studio and I play 7 instruments so I love playing along to my favorite songs. I also teach web development to keep my skills sharp, continue learning and to pay forward some of the amazing opportunities that I've received while working in the field. I also like to study machine learning and AI because I think one day we can utilize it in the web development sphere for more than just algorithmic engagement but additionally to help innovate in more engaging and intuitive design ideologies. 

In short, I'm just a web developer seeking an opportunity to use my capabilities to revolutionize the World Wide Web. We can discuss the revolution over a cup of coffee; isn't that how most revolutions start?
