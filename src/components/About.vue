        </div>
        <p class="py-10 text-xl sm:text-xl text-gray-400">Information to contact me is in my resume above!</p> 
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black">I'm a pre-med student turned tech-enthusiast who loves wearing more hats than can fit on his head.
            If I could have a degree for learning, I would. 
            It gives me so much energy to learn something new and be able to apply it. 
        </p> <br>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black">
            In my professional time, I've slowly focused in on the parts of the web development field that bring me the most enjoyment. 
            I've gained a lot of experience doing things like project managing, designing graphics, redesigning features, identifying user needs, creating intuitive experiences and developing functional prototypes. 
            I keep my sights aligned down that path and thats how I became a Principal Designer and Solutions Architect. 
        </p> <br>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black">
            Because I love diversity in my creations, I tend to like working for a company that deals with multiple clients in different categories i.e.: Finance, Logistics, Entertainment, Food, Content Sharing, CRMs, Warehouse Management (just to name a few).
            This gives me the best opportunity to create revolutionary designs to solve a business need!     
        </p> <br>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black">
            In my spare time, I have my home office set up as a record studio and I play 7 instruments, so I love playing along and covering my favorite songs. I also teach web development and web design to keep my skills sharp, continue learning and to pay forward the amazing opportunities that I've received while working in the field.
            I also like to study machine learning and AI development because I think one day we can utilize it in the web development sphere for more than just algorithmic engagement, but additionally to help innovate in more engaging and intuitive design ideologies.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-black">
            In short, I'm just a web developer seeking an opportunity to use my capabilitites to revolutionize the World Wide Web. We can discuss the revolution over a cup of coffee; isn't that how most revolutions start anyway?
